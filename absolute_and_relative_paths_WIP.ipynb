    "## Default Behaviour\n",
    "Pandas by default looks for the file in the directory that you are running the script from. \n",
    "\n",
    "So say if you are looking to run a file with absolute path: \n",
    " C:/Users/Home/example.csv\n",
    " \n",
    "Provided you are running the python script that loads the 'example.csv' file from the directory:\n",
    " C:/Users/Home/\n",
    "You do not need to specify the filepath at all, you can just put the file name:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('example.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Be Careful\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful not to confuse the location that you are running the script from, with the location of the script itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often these two locations are the same. For example, consider the below folder structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "\n",
    "└── C:/\n",
    "    └── Users/\n",
    "        └── Home/\n",
    "            └── project/\n",
    "                ├── main.py\n",
    "                └── example.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where main.py contains a simple script that reads a CSV file using pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('example.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you run main.py from the project subdirectory:\n",
    "```cmd\n",
    "C:\\Users\\Home\\project>python main.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "The script will run with no problem and *example.csv* will be loaded into a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you run main.py from the directory above, Home/, the script will fail. This is because read_csv will look for the file in the location that the script is being run, not the location of the file itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cmd\n",
    "C:\\Users\\Home>python project\\main.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or put more explicitly, read_csv() will look relative to *C:\\Users\\Home*, not *C:\\Users\\Home\\project*.\n",
